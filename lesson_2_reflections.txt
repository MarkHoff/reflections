What happens when you initialize a repository?  Why do you need to do it?

A .git file is created.  This will allow you to start running commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a temporary holding place for files that haven't yet been committed.  It's a way to separate versions of files from the working directory without doing a full commit.  It help you logically group commits.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can use the git diff command to show you which files are staged between the working directory and the staging area.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized?  How would branches help?

When you want to make a slightly different version of your application but don't necessarily want to modify the main branch.  You can create a new branch, name it something descriptive, and work on your app in that branch.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
They help you see the parent-child relationships in the different branches as well as the common parent before the branches split off.

What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

Pros:  You don't have to remember to merge if it's done automatically.
Cons:  It may merge two branches before you're ready to merge them.
